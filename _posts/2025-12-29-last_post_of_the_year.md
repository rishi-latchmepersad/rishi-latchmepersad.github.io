title: Last Post Of The Year!

# Intro
It's starting to feel like this is a blog for me to post about getting sick... 😷

I spent two weeks this month recovering from another flu. It was terrible. This time I had to go to the doctor and take antibiotics etc. At least I'm better now. I was able to visit my relatives etc. and mostly enjoy my Christmas! 🎅

I'm just annoyed that I missed most of my vacation because I was in bed.

# Productive Vibes

On the positive side, I was actually able to meet with Tevin and get the paper done. We spent one day at his place, and then one day at mine writing the paper and reviewing the results, and we refined our sections virtually afterwards. 

We just submitted the first draft to the journal editor yesterday! 🔥

I'm really excited for this one because it aligns perfectly with the future I imagine for myself (working in embedded systems and creating cool gadgets), and it even involves AI and ML, but mostly because this paper was driven by me (with a little encouragement from Tevin). It's not something that I had to do at all for anyone else.

Now we just need to spend a few months reviewing the manuscript with the WIJE reviewers, and then we should hopefully have it ready by July next year!

# Making Embedded Systems

I also made a big push to finish some of the books on my list. The first one was the book by Elicia White: Making Embedded Systems.

I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to work or already works in the embedded systems field. Reading the book felt like I was having a chat with a really experienced embedded engineer, about all sorts of areas and projects she had worked on in her life. It's not a really in-depth book on any one area, but that's what makes it so applicable to so many engineers.

Based on this foundation, I think that most engineers would have a much better foundation, and could use the further readings etc. to get more in-depth knowledge of whatever area they're interested in.

# Conclusion

For me, the next steps are to build a better foundation in C (I still feel like I don't understand memory management etc. well enough), and then to do at least one small course in computer vision ML to start my thesis.

I've already ordered my parts from Mouser, and I'm going to spend the time waiting with the C book and the CV course.
