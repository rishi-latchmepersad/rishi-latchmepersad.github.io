I haven't posted in a while, because I went on vacation! ðŸŽ‰

My wife and I took a short trip to Japan. It was a ton of fun!

I actually used the trip as an opportunity to visit an electronics shop, and I bought my first embedded board (an STM32 uC board). Look out for some beginner projects
in that coming up!

I also spent some time reading two books. One of them was a really fun book that got me even more fired up to study embedded.

It's name was Chip War, written by Chris Miller. It goes through the last couple decades of semiconductor development, and highlights just how important
semiconductor chips and embedded systems have become in our modern world.

I also studied another more-serious book. It's called Digital Design and Computer Architecture: ARM Edition by John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson.
This one was a lot more technical and difficult to follow along, but I toughed it out and got to the end. I feel like it's an excellent primer or a refresher
if you've done a Bachelor's degree like Electrical Engineering. It covers things like boolean logic, logic gates and microprocessors.

Now that I'm back from vacation, I'm looking forward to experimenting with my new STM32 board and truly learning about embedded systems!
