title: Starting Machine Learning!

# Intro
Wow it's been almost 2 months since my last post. Unfortunately, I came down with the flu 😷, and I also had several key family
events that took up time (such as Divali 🔥). 

Luckily, we're back now! Over the past couple of weeks, I've made some small improvements to the project, and we've had
some exciting news as well!

# Machine Learning
I started working on a Google colab notebook to create a simple ML model to predict temperature. For now, I'm just using an open
API to source the training dataset, but eventually we'll switch over to using our own collected data.
