title: First Post of the Year!

# Intro
We're at the end of week 2 of the new year! It's been quite a hectic two weeks, mainly because we're back to the office 3 days a week now ☹
It sucks a bit, but at least I still have a great job that I love and we have a great work environment. We're also still allowed flexi-hours, so we don't have to remain stuck in the traffic too much.

# Productive Vibes

I was able to put in my order with Mouser Electronics late last year, and it actually reached in around 1-2 weeks! I was surprised! 🎉

I really had to pay out of my nose for it though. I paid 60$ USD to ship the small box from the US to Trinidad, then another 400$ TTD to clear it here. Hopefully I won't need to order much more equipment here.

I haven't even opened the packages yet, because I'm waiting to build my foundations a bit more. After the first paper we wrote last year (which we're still reviewing with the journal), I realized that my C foundations and my ML foundations were weak, so I've begun my C programming book (by K.N King) and my computer vision ML course (by Andrej Karpathy).

Both have been really helpful so far, and I believe they'll be instrumental in my future work.

# Conclusion

Once I finish the CV course (because it's a bit shorter), I'll move onto actually building the prototype of my thesis. I should be able to get the basic parts of it working. I'm hoping if I build a good github repo demonstrating my work, I'll be able to get some great support from my potential supervisors and be accepted to some good schools 👨‍🎓
