Recently, I've begun thinking that I might actually enjoy a career in embedded systems engineering.

As a test for myself, I figured I could follow along with a simple tutorial in C, to decide if I could handle the main
language in the embedded world. I found a fun course by a Youtube channel called Bro Code:

I decided to try to follow along with the course, and I think I did really well!

The course spent some time with the basics in C (variables, functions, loops, etc), and then it went on to
program a cool console-based tic-tac-toe game where you play against the computer.

It's not very advanced, since the computer doesn't have much strategy, but it was a fun little project to do.

Please see my repo here, and follow along with the tutorial if you would be interested in something similar.
